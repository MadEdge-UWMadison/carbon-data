Synergy between compost and cover crops in a Mediterranean row crop system leads to increased subsoil carbon storage,"Daniel Rath, Nathaniel Bogie, Leonardo Deiss, Sanjai J.

Each treatment sampled in this paper consisted of three plots under tomato and three plots under corn to give a total of nine corn plots and nine tomato plots in total. All plots were irrigated with subsurface drip at the time of sampling, having converted from furrow irrigation to subsurface drip in 2014. All plots also received four tillage passes to a depth of 20.5 cm, and ORG and CONV+WCC plots received additional tillage passes to 6.5 cm to incorporate cover crop and compost residue (Table A5).",CONV (mineral fertilizer),110,,,-3,,,,,,,,,,
